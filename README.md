## Project Overview

In 2019, the United States hosted more than 79 million international tourists. These visitors add to the country's diverse social fabric and contribute to its thriving economy. The U.S. government, tourism industry and other would benefit from a well-organized data lake that would enable a better decision framework. Therefore, the United States Travel Association (USTA) contracted our team do design and implement an ETL pipeline that results in a data lake.

One of the main reasons for implementing a data lake is the scale of the U.S. tourism sector. On average, more tha 9,000 arrive to the U.S. every hour. Our goal was to capture each individual. We We also incorporated other data sources - e.g. weather and locational socioeconomic data - into the data lake. 

Additionally, the USTA is not the primary user of this data. There are various stakeholders, who all have difference interests/requirements. Developing a schematized database would place constraints on the end users. A data lake provides more flexibility for each end user's application.
